         "content":"Active working memory can hold fewer things for less time than most people think. Having knowledge robustly stored in long term memory aids studentsâ€™ ability to engage in higher order thinking tasks. Research also suggests that robust knowledge building is a crucial, and often overlooked, initial step in project based learning. ",

      },
      {
         "content":"Emotional and cognitive functions in the brain are highly interlinked. Research shows that stress, fear and fatigue affect brain systems in ways that inhibit learning. Just because a teacher has covered something, it does not mean that learning has necessarily taken place. For quality learning to take place, each teacher needs to take into account factors such as stress, fear and fatigue.",

         "solution":2
      },
      {
         "content":"Because handwriting is slower, we are forced to interpret and paraphrase what a speaker says instead of simply producing a transcript. This act of synthesis leads to better semantic processing, which means that schematic changes to long-term memory are likely to be taking place as notes are taken. Typing, because it demands less of us, results in less change to long-term memory.",

Many researchers have tried to prove this, but there is no evidence for it being true â€“ and in fact, it can even hinder learning.
